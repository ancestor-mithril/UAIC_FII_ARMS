## Project description

Retrieval of information from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) using Crawlers and the official [api](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/api/v2) in order to create a small dataset of users and their preferences. After preprocessing and organizing the information, [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) is used for clustering and visualization of information. Further analysis consists of identifying preference groups and creating a Naive Bayes model for recommending anime to users.
